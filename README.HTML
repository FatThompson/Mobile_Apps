                        This is the walk through of the assignment number 2. 
                        It involves loading the application on both the android and browser
                        and walking through how to run both, though the instructions
                        are same for both. This is done so the application can be shown 
                        working on both environments. Please enjoy the video, 
                        and if there are any questions, please contact me at

                                The application runs on both Android and the Browser environments.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the application loads, clicking the button will load an alert message.
